# DCNN
This is the published codes for 
Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for Sequential Manifold-valued Data in Neuroimaging (ICCV 2019).

The medical dataset cannot be published because of the private issue.

The USF11 dataset is similar to the SPD-SRU in my github.

When running the codes, be sure that run Preprocessed_UCF11.py first.
