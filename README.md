# DCNN
This is the published code for 
[Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks for Sequential Manifold-valued Data *ICCV 2019*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02206).

The medical dataset cannot be published because of the private issue.

The UCF11 dataset is similar to the SPD-SRU in my github.

When running the codes, be sure that run Preprocessed_UCF11.py first.

Then run the manifoldDCNN_forUCF11.py.

The DTI and the ODF is for reference if you have your own datasets.
